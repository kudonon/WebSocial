This project is an attempt to create a template social media website that 
includes all the basic features (registration, login, dashboard) using 
the languages PHP, SQL and HTML.

It also provides some basic security features to prevent amateur hacks.

This website is meant to be set up on a raspberry pi that also has MySQL
or MariaDB installed into it. The program assumes that there is already
a database created on MySQL/MariaDB with the name WebSocial and it is
located on the local host. 

The WebSocial database on MySQL/MariaDB is meant to have a primary key ID, a 
name column, a user_id column and a password column. The code to instantiate 
the database is located in the 'Futher Instruction' folder.

This website is meant to be extended further to add more interactive functions, 
but the purpose of this project is to create a basic template that would have
user-authentication, login and a common dashboard with the use of session cookies.

Enjoy!
